# Validation Security Design

  - Layer 1: HTTP endpoints validate before publishing to Redis
  - Layer 2: Redis task processor validates when fetching from Redis
  - Shared Code: Both layers use the same validation functions to ensure consistency

  This ensures robust validation at both entry points (HTTP) and processing points (Redis task fetching), with shared validation logic to maintain consistency and reduce code duplication.
